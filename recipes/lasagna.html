    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with made from scratch tomato sauce and delicious, cheesy filling. 
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread, if desired.

            In a 9x13 inch baking dish, place 2 layers of noodles on the bottom of dish; layer 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 
            1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/2 of the sauce; repeat layers.
