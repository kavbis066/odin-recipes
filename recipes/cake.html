        Simple, delicious coffee cake recipe that my mom made for company. I took the basic recipe and added blueberries.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir
             in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. 
             Sir in blueberries. Pour batter into prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, combine flour and sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over 
            top of batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake 
            comes out clean. Allow to cool.
        </li>
    </ol>
